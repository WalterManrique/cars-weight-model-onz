BYOD Lab: Loading a Model and Using it for Scoring from Python on z/OS

This repository contains material needed for the SHARE Cleveland workshop titled "BYOD Lab: Loading a Model and Using it for Scoring from Python on z/OS". 

It is an interactive workshop that walks through the steps to import and deploy a model into MLz 3.2 and afterwards uses the model for inferencing. The user learns to access the scoring services provided by MLz 3.2 from a python program running on z/OS via a Jupyter Notebook. The code will submit queries to the scoring server via a standard REST API using JSON.

The material in this repository includes the workshop handout, the cars-test-model.tar.gz model file, and the cars.ipynb file with the python source code.
